Error message only mentions username when both fields are empty

1. Go to https://www.saucedemo.com
2. Leave the Username field empty
3. Leave the Password field emptyy
4. Click the Login buttonn

5. Expected Result:

An error message clearly states that both username and password are rquired ina neutral, professional tone.

Actual Result:

An error message appears that says "Epic sadface: Username is required" even though both fields are empty, and the wording is informal.

Minor

Notes:

This is a copy and UX issue. It does not block login, but the message can confuse users and may not match a professional product tone.
